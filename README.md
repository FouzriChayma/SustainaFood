SustainaFood: Revolutionizing Food Redistribution 🌍
 
A Feast of Waste in a Hungry WorldPicture this: shelves groaning with unsold bread, crates of slightly bruised apples that nobody bought. Across the street, a student digs through their bag for the last crumpled ramen packet, while an NGO volunteer sighs over an empty pantry. It’s a tale of two worlds—one drowning in excess, the other starving for a chance. Society produces more than enough food, yet millions go hungry. It’s not a supply issue—it’s a distribution failure.

SustainaFood is here to bridge that gap. Developed as a 4th-year integrated project at Esprit School of Engineering, SustainaFood is a platform designed to tackle food waste in Tunisia and Setif by connecting food donors (restaurants, supermarkets, personal donors), recipients (NGOs, students), and transporters in a seamless, efficient ecosystem. Our mission is to turn surplus into sustenance, ensuring no food goes to waste while no one goes hungry.
🎯 Project Vision
SustainaFood addresses the paradox of food waste and hunger by:

Redistributing Surplus: Connecting donors with excess food to recipients in need.
Optimizing Logistics: Assigning transporters to ensure timely deliveries.
Leveraging AI: Using machine learning to detect donation anomalies, predict supply/demand, and classify food items.
Empowering Communities: Enabling NGOs, students, restaurants, supermarkets, and individuals to participate in a sustainable food ecosystem.

🚀 Features

Donation Management: Create, update, and track food donations (prepared meals or packaged products).
Request System: NGOs and students can request specific food items based on their needs.
AI-Powered Insights:
Anomaly detection to flag suspicious donations (e.g., large quantities near expiry).
Supply/demand forecasting to anticipate food needs.
Food classification to ensure donations meet recipient requirements.


Delivery Coordination: Assign transporters to deliveries and track their status.
User Roles: Supports multiple roles (admin, donor, recipient, transporter) with role-based access control.
Analytics Dashboards: Provide donors and recipients with insights into their contributions and fulfilled requests.
Notifications: Real-time alerts for donation approvals, rejections, and delivery updates.
Feedback System: Allows users to rate and review delivery experiences.
Google Authentication: Secure login with Google OAuth and optional 2FA.
Backoffice for Admins: Manage users, donations, requests, and anomalies with a comprehensive admin dashboard.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend

Node.js & Express: RESTful API for handling requests and business logic.
MongoDB & Mongoose: NoSQL database for storing donations, requests, users, and transactions.
Passport.js: Google OAuth for secure authentication.
JWT: Token-based authentication for secure API access.
Nodemailer: Email notifications for donation approvals/rejections and user actions.
